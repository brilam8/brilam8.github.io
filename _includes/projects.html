    <h1>My projects</h1>
    <p>These are some of the passion projects that I have taken on throughout my programming career. Some of these projects are polished and complete while others remained prototypes that I could learn and build off of in the future. I primarily focus on
        back-end development, integrating databases, and unit testing built APIs. Hover over each project to find out more!
