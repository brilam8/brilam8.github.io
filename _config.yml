user_description: Hey! I am a Computer Science student at University of California - San Diego, and an aspiring software engineer. I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and projects to tackle, especially ones that allow me to dive deeper into the programming world and learn new things! Lately, I have been focusing on back-end development for numerous side projects, building RESTful API's, testing routes, and writing documentation for all future developers.
